abstract = {Disease spreading simulations are traditionally performed using coupled differential equations. However, in the setting of metapopulations, most of the solutions provided by this method do not account for the dynamic topography of subpopulations. Conversely, the alternative approach of individual-based modeling (IBM) may add computational cost and complexity. Hybrid models allow for the study of disease spreading because they combine both aforementioned approaches by separating them across different scales: a local scale that addresses subpopulation dynamics using coupled differential equations and a global scale that addresses the contact between these subpopulations using IBM. We present a simple way of simulating the spread of disease in dynamic networks using the high-level statistical computational language R and the hybridModels package. We built four examples using disease spread models at the local scale in several different networks: an animal movement network; a three-node network, whose model solution using a stochastic simulation algorithm is compared with the ordinary differential equations approach; the commuting of individuals between patches, which we compare with the permanent migration of individuals; and the commuting of individuals within the metropolitan area of S{\~{a}}o Paulo.},

abstract = {We introduce Pathogen.jl for simulation and inference of transmission network individual level models (TN-ILMs) of infectious disease spread in continuous time. TN-ILMs can be used to jointly infer transmission networks, event times, and model parameters within a Bayesian framework via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We detail our specific strategies for conducting MCMC for TN-ILMs, and our implementation of these strategies in the Julia package, Pathogen.jl, which leverages key features of the Julia lan-guage. We provide an example using Pathogen.jl to simulate an epidemic following a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) TN-ILM, and then perform inference using observations that were generated from that epidemic. We also demonstrate the functionality of Pathogen.jl with an application of TN-ILMs to data from a measles outbreak that occurred in Hagelloch, Germany, in 1861 (Pfeilsticker 1863; Oesterle 1992).},

abstract = {The 2022 FIFA World Cup was the first major multi-continental sporting Mass Gathering Event (MGE) of the post COVID-19 era to allow foreign spectators. Such large-scale MGEs can potentially lead to outbreaks of infectious disease and contribute to the global dissemination of such pathogens. Here we adapt previous work and create a generalisable model framework for assessing the use of disease control strategies at such events, in terms of reducing infections and hospitalisations. This framework utilises a combination of meta-populations based on clusters of people and their vaccination status, Ordinary Differential Equation integration between fixed time events, and Latin Hypercube sampling. We use the FIFA 2022 World Cup as a case study for this framework. Pre-travel screenings of visitors were found to have little effect in reducing COVID-19 infections and hospitalisations. With pre-match screenings of spectators and match staff being more effective. Rapid Antigen (RA) screenings 0.5 days before match day outperformed RT-PCR screenings 1.5 days before match day. A combination of pre-travel RT-PCR and pre-match RA testing proved to be the most successful screening-based regime. However, a policy of ensuring that all visitors had a COVID-19 vaccination (second or booster dose) within a few months before departure proved to be much more efficacious. The State of Qatar abandoned all COVID-19 related travel testing and vaccination requirements over the period of the World Cup. Our work suggests that the State of Qatar may have been correct in abandoning the pre-travel testing of visitors. However, there was a spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations within Qatar over the World Cup. The research outlined here suggests a policy requiring visitors to have had a recent COVID-19 vaccination may have prevented the increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations during the world cup.},

@article{Almutiry2021,
abstract = {This paper describes the R package EpiILMCT, which allows users to study the spread of infectious disease using continuous time individual level models (ILMs). The package provides tools for simulation from continuous time ILMs that are based on either spatial demographic, contact network, or a combination of both of them, and for the graphical summarization of epidemics. Model fitting is carried out within a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework. The continuous time ILMs can be implemented within either susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) or susceptible-infected-notified-removed (SIN R) compartmental frameworks. As infectious disease data is often partially observed, data uncertainties in the form of missing infection times – and in some situations missing removal times – are accounted for using data augmentation techniques. The package is illustrated using both simulated and an experimental data set on the spread of the tomato spotted wilt virus disease.},

abstract = {individual is an R package which provides users a set of useful primitive elements for specifying individual-based models (IBMs), also called agent-based models (ABMs), with special attention to models for infectious disease epidemiology. Users build models by specifying variables for each characteristic describing individuals in the simulated population using data structures from the package. individual provides efficient methods for finding subsets of individuals based on these variables, or cohorts. Cohorts can then be targeted for variable updates or scheduled for events. Variable updates queued during a time step are executed at the end of a discrete time step, and the code places no restrictions on how individuals are allowed to interact. These data structures are designed to provide an intuitive way for users to turn their conceptual model of a system into executable code, which is fast and memory efficient.},

abstract = {Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) are used throughout science where the capture of rates of change in states is sought. While both pieces of commercial and open software exist to study such systems, their efficient and accurate usage frequently requires deep understanding of mathematics and programming. The package we present here, PyGOM, seeks to remove these obstacles for models based on ODE systems. We provide a simple interface for the construction of such systems backed by a comprehensive and easy to use tool--box. This tool--box implements functions to easily perform common operations for ODE systems such as solving, parameter estimation, and stochastic simulation. The package source is freely available and organized in a way that permits easy extension. With both the algebraic and numeric calculations performed automatically (but still accessible), the end user is freed to focus on model development.},

EpiModel integrates recent advances in statistical methods for network analysis (temporal exponential random graph models) that allow the epidemic modeling to be grounded in empirical data on contacts that can spread infection.
