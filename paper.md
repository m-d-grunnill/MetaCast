# Summary

`MetaCast` is a Python package for broadcasting epidemiological and ecological ODE based models
over metapopulations (structured populations). Users define a function describing the
subpopulation model. `MetaCast`'s `MetaCaster` then broadcasts the subpopulation model function over dimensions
of metapopulations. These dimensions can be defined and redefined flexibly allowing for comparisons
of multidimensional metapopulation models, that can have migration (flows) of populations between
subpopulations. In addition to the metapopulation suite `MetaCast` has several features. A
multinomial seeder allows users to randomly select infected stages to place an infected
population in based on the occupancy time of infected states. `MetaCast`'s event queue suite
can handle discrete events within simulations, such as movement of populations between compartments and changes in 
parameter values. Sensitivity analysis can be done in `MetaCast` using parallelisable Latin Hypercube Sampling and 
Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient functions. All of this makes MetaCast an ideal package not only for modelling 
metapopulations but for wider scenario analysis.

# Statement of need

`MetaCast` was developed from the code base used in a project modelling the spread of 
COVID-19 at Mass Gathering Events (MGEs), such as the FIFA 2022 World Cup [@Grunnill2023a; @Grunnill2024]. 
During this project there were a number of MGEs that we considered as potential case studies
before settling on the FIFA 2022 World Cup. As such, even though our epidemiological model 
was remaining much the same, the resulting change in metapopulation structure between potential case study models
meant we had to extensively recode the model. In order expedite this recoding due to changes in metapopulation
structure we developed the code in @Grunnill2023a. This code allowed us to broadcast our COVID-19 subpopulation model
over different two-dimensional metapopulations, whilst calculating the force of infections for all subpopulations
[@Keeling2008c]. The dimensions (groupings) being different cluster of people (subtypes of hosts or visitors) and 
vaccination status [@Grunnill2024]. `MetaCast` builds upon the code in @Grunnill2023a by allowing for more than two 
dimensions, that don't require a basis in clusters or vaccination status. `MetaCast` also includes more user-friendly versions 
of the discrete event, sensitivity analyses and infectious population seeding features from @Grunnill2023a 
[@Grunnill2024]. This makes MetaCast an ideal package for scenario analyses based around metapopulation models within 
epidemiology or ecology.

# State of Field

There are a number of packages that can be used for epidemiological or ecological modelling across a number of 
platforms including Python. However, to our knowledge none bring together all the features for scenario analyses based 
around ODE metapopulation models as described above.

#### Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Modelling Packages for Epidemiology
R's `EpiMode` [@Jenness2018] has some pre-coded epidemiological ODE models (such as SIR and SIS), as does
 the Python package `Eir` [@Jacob2021]. `EpiMode` [@Jenness2018] can also perform a sensitivity analyses on these 
pre-coded models. `PyGOM` [@Tye2018] and `Epipack` [@Maier2021] are Python packages that can produce ODE models from 
defining transitions between epidemiological compartments. Both `PyGOM` [@Tye2018] and `Epipack` [@Maier2021] can 
then simulate the ODE models deterministically or stochastically, with `PyGOM` having some extra stochastic methods. 
`PyGOM` [@Tye2018] also has a suite of maximum likelihood based and Approximate Bayesian Computation fitting procedures.

#### Individual Based Modelling (IBM) Packages for Epidemiology
Python's `Epipack` [@Maier2021] has modules for defining transitions between states for nodes in network 
modelling. R's `EpiMode` [@Jenness2018] has agent based modelling based around contacts as discrete events or as a 
static network. There are a number of other R epidemiological IBM packages that take spatial or network contact based
approaches,  `individual` [@Charles2021], `hybridModels` [@Marques2020] and `EpiILMCT` [@Almutiry2021].
The Python package `Eir` [@Jacob2021] has epidemiological models that incorporate the movements of people. 
`Pathogen.jl` [@Angevaare2022] is a Julia package for continuous time simulation and inference of transmission network 
individual level models (TN-ILMs).
